        Peaky Blinders is a crime drama series set in Birmingham, England in
        1919. The series revolves around Thomas Shelby, the leader of the
        criminal gang called Peaky Blinders, in the post-World War I era. It
        focuses on the Shelby family's quest for ambition, power, and revenge.
        Under Thomas Shelby's leadership, the gang deals with businesses such as
        illegal gambling, alcohol, and arms trafficking. As a smart, strategic,
        and ruthless leader, Thomas tries to protect his family from all kinds
        of dangers while also trying to grow the gang even more. The series
        depicts the dynamics of the Shelby family and the difficulties they
        face, while also dealing with the social and political atmosphere of the
        period. Thomas and other characters, who have experienced the traumas of
        World War I, struggle with the burdens of the past. Arthur Shelby's
        anger problems, Polly Gray's strong leadership, John Shelby's courage,
        and Michael Gray's ambition enrich the series' character diversity.
        Peaky Blinders draws attention with its character depth, historical
        background, and strong visuals. The series, which blends both crime and
        drama elements, has become a cult production over time. It has also been
        highly acclaimed for its music choices and visuals that reflect the
        atmosphere of the period.
